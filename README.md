# Scripts
A lot of general purpose scripts for my machines.

#### To Do
* Write a script to auto-arrange all the files in this repo according to use, need and other criteria in an alphabetical/chronological order.

## File List:
### File Management
|1. dUShow.sh	|	Shows the UUID for any device (/dev/sda) mounted on the system. Use without arguments or flags to see usage.|
|---|---|
|2. rearrange.sh	|	Rearranges the files in this repository on the basis of a certain criteria, and auto-generates the file list in this README file.|
